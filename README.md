## Containers and Metadata
The repository builds and provides a set of containers and metadata files to help you run and understand the experiment.

 - [preview the experiment](https://expfactory-experiments.github.io/nback-10min-animals/) on Github pages
 - [use the container](https://hub.docker.com/r/expfactory/nback-10min-animals/) provided on Docker Hub, built from this repository. All previous versions are also found here based on Github commits.
 - [inspect metadata](https://github.com/expfactory-experiments/nback-10min-animals/tree/gh-pages) including manifests and packages associated with Github commits. While this table isn't rendered on Github pages, if you render the branch and look at the index.html you will have a pretty rendering of it.
